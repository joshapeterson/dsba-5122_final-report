["index.html", "Nobel Prize Winners 1 Introduction", " Nobel Prize Winners Group 13: Dipin Kasana, Kelly O’Shields &amp; Joshua Peterson December 9, 2019 1 Introduction The Nobel Prize is a global distinction that is awarded to top scientists and thinkers in their respective fields of study. It was established by the will of Alfred Nobel - a wealthy Scandanavian - who left most of his estate to the establishment of the Nobel Prize. He set forth that the prize be awarded annually in the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Peace, Chemistry, Literature, and Economic Sciences. Additionally, he dictated that the awarding institutions should select “those who… have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.” (nobelprize.org, 2019) Our goal is to produce an analytical tool that will help inform these institutions in their future decisions. In order for these institutions to better inform their decisions in the future, it will be essential to understand what has happened historically. For example, it is known that there is a gender disparity among Nobel Prize winners. Furthermore, they may favor certain subjects or entities when making their decisions. Being able to provide a tool that provides insight into these issues would be an incredibly important part of helping to address these biases, disparities and issues in the future. This app facilitates insights into prior Nobel Prize winners for them to consider when making future decisions and would help broaden the scope of potential winners and topics. Additionally, it would enhance the decision making process of these institutions to ensure a more diverse and expansive population of winners. "],
["dataoperation-abstraction-design.html", "2 Data/Operation Abstraction Design 2.1 Data Description 2.2 Overview of Data", " 2 Data/Operation Abstraction Design 2.1 Data Description For this project, the team selected data from one of the TidyTuesday projects on Nobel Prize winners available on GitHub. The dataset included two files, the first dataset provided details about all Nobel Prize winners since 1901, whereas, the second dataset included the details on all the publications by Nobel Prize winners for three of the categories (Chemistry, Physics, and Medicine). The first dataset, “nobel_winners”, included demographic details on 969 Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2016 and the motivation for awarding the nobel prize in their respective category (Economics, Peace, Literature, Chemistry, Physics, and Medicine). The second dataset, “nobel_winners_all_pubs”, included details on 545 academic professionals and their publications prior to winning the Nobel Prize. 2.2 Overview of Data Nobel Prize Data All Publications of Nobel Prize Winners Data These two datasets were utilized to create the application. As seen above in the “nobel_winners” data, there were a number of records that contained an “NA” observation. Therefore, those “NA” observations had to be addressed as well as other data cleaning matters. Example of Removing “NA” Observations text &lt;- nobel_winner_all_pubs %&gt;% filter(is_prize_winning_paper == &quot;YES&quot;) %&gt;% filter(prize_year &gt;= input$year_journal_org[1] &amp; prize_year &lt;= input$year_journal_org[2]) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(journal)) %&gt;% count(journal) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) Additionally, we also performed much of our data prep outside of the Shiny app. This was done to help minimize the number of lines of code within the actual app and to help organize the code for usage. The global data preperation included the creation of specific data frames and functions to be utilized within the application. Example of Function getFreq_motivation &lt;- function(data, prize_category, year1, year2) { tidy_motivation &lt;- data %&gt;% unnest_tokens(word, motivation) %&gt;% anti_join(stop_words) if (prize_category != &quot;All&quot;) { tidy_motivation_n &lt;- tidy_motivation %&gt;% filter(category == prize_category) %&gt;% filter(prize_year &gt;= year1 &amp; prize_year &lt;= year2) %&gt;% count(word) %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) } else { tidy_motivation_n &lt;- tidy_motivation %&gt;% filter(prize_year &gt;= year1 &amp; prize_year &lt;= year2) %&gt;% count(word) %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) } return(tidy_motivation_n) } The function above was created to prepare the text to be utilized for in the Motivation and Paper Title Analysis section. This function - and another like it - were responsible for preparing the text to be used in the server to aid in the creation of the output. "],
["encodinginteraction-design.html", "3 Encoding/Interaction Design 3.1 Overview 3.2 Motivation and Paper Title Analysis 3.3 Publication and Age Analysis", " 3 Encoding/Interaction Design The core of our application was divided into three sections on which to display our output. This was based on the division of the types of analyses deemed to be needed for this project. 3.1 Overview The “Overview” section was provided as a way for these institutions to get some general information on winners, journals and organization. Therefore, the output is reflective of this fact. Info boxes are provided to show general stats, which a table of the full output is provided for their reference if needed. A similar output is provided on the “Journals and Organizations” tab. However, instead of providing stats, the top journals and organizations producing Nobel Prize winners is provided. Winners Tab Journals and Organizations Tab 3.2 Motivation and Paper Title Analysis The “Motivation and Paper Title Analysis” section was provided so these institutions could better understand their motivations as well as which papers typically do or do not get Nobel Prizes. The “Motivation for Award” tab shows which words typically show up in the institutions stated motivation for awarding the Nobel Prize to an individual. Therefore, this offers a great way for them to better understand their motivations for giving the awards they have in the past. Motivation for Award Tab The “Paper Titles” tab is fairly similar. It provides the same output; however, it analyzes the titles of papers. This would allow these institutions to better understand which papers by these individuals have typically won a Nobel Prize and which have not. 3.3 Publication and Age Analysis The “Publication and Age Analysis” section include the “Publication Analysis” and “Age Analysis” tabs, which would help the users to explore the academic and demographic characteristics of all Nobel Prize winners. In particular, the “Publication Analysis” tab allows users to study the academic characteristics of Nobel Prize winners among three categories (Chemistry, Physics, and Medicine). The first plot provides the violin distribution of the number of publications for Nobel Prize winners in their respective category, which helps to quantify the academic accomplishments of the winners. Also, the user can explore the variation in the distribution of the total number of publications over time by filtering for the range of prize awarded years. In addition to the violin distribution, the second plot on the tab allows users to investigate the average academic experience of Nobel Prize winners. Based on the selected range of prize awarded years, the output reveals the average academic experience of winners among three categories, which was calculated using the time between awarded year and the year of first publication. Violin Plot Horizontal Bar Chart Publications Filter The “Age Analysis” tab allow users to investigate the average age of Nobel Prize recipients and the total awards won by different countries among all six award categories. The filter option for selecting the category and range of awarded years enable the users to understand the shift in demographic characteristics of winners over time across different countries. Moreover, the results for the average age of a recipient across countries, as shown in Figure XX, can be compared against the output table, which includes the list of countries from the bar chart and the number of awards won by each of them.

["algorithmic-design.html", "4 Algorithmic Design", " 4 Algorithmic Design The code for the shiny app was initially divided into two parts. One part that contained all the global functions, datasets, and other items that were not required within the Shiny app. The second part included the main three components of the shiny app (User Interface, Server, and ShinyApp). The code was divided into two parts, app.r and global.r, for easier understanding and improved performance of the functions called within the shiny app code. However, in the process of deploying the application, this separation of the code was causing issues in the deployment. Therefore, the global code was added back into the app.R file. However, to assist with code readability, we in the future we would separate our code between these two files again to help with readability and improve performance. At this time though, all the code has been included within the app.R file. The main code to develop the shiny app has been arranged in the order of executed output. The user interface (UI) section includes input and output commands in the same order as displayed on the app, which allows users to easily track the specific areas of code. Similarly, the code in the server function of the shiny app has been arranged in congruence with the UI commands. The team utilized various reactive functions to modularize the app and avoid unnecessary computations for enhanced performance. Furthermore, r packages such as DT, waiter and validate have been utilized to help improve interaction with the app. "],
["user-evaluation.html", "5 User Evaluation 5.1 Who are Our Users? 5.2 Testing the App", " 5 User Evaluation 5.1 Who are Our Users? The app was primarily developed for the Nobel Prize awarding institutions; which includes the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, The Swedish Academy, and a Committee from the Norwegian Parliament. These committees or entities are tasked with selecting the most suited Nobel Prize recipient among all six categories. These four institutions can utilize the app to study the characteristics of historic winners and evaluate if their decisions include any biases towards favoring particular universities, countries, or gender. The app would also assist users to broaden their scope for selection of future winners by identifying most frequently awarded topics, motivations for the award or journals. Finally, the app could also be used by any researcher or individual aiming to get insights on Nobel Prize winners and their journey as a winner. 5.2 Testing the App FIrst, we would use the Human-Computer Interaction to test if the average person can understand and use the app with ease. We would like to analyze the effects of the app on the final users, access the functionality of the app, and identify any problems that might arise when the end user is using the app. We would do this during the prototype phase of the app development before moving into the final production. We would have the end user evaluate the app based on the following criteria: Functionality, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Usability and usefulness. We could also assess the usability of the app via a walkthrough of the application with users. We would sit down with individuals and see how they interact with and use the app. Also, we would set various tasks in the app and evaluate how each user accomplishes or doesn’t accomplish the task. Therefore, coming to understand the various issues or roadblocks they may face. Additionally, this would give us an opportunity to perform A|B test of the application. We could provide two different versions of the app to sets of people performing these tasks to see what effect the changes have on their ability to perform the task. "],
["future-work.html", "6 Future Work", " 6 Future Work Initially, the project team aimed to develop a guiding tool for Nobel Prize awarding institutions as well as academic professionals that would allow them to explore historic data, identify key insights, and improve their decision making abilities. The team was able to accomplish most of the objectives set for the Nobel Prize awarding institutions using the developed shiny app, however, the goals drafted for academic professionals were treated as out of the project scope due to limitations imposed by the dataset. In particular, the team struggled to merge the two available dataset, nobel_winners and nobe_winners_publications, as the unique laureate id were different in both datasets. The objectives laid out by the project team for academic professionals aimed to increase their likelihood of winning the nobel prize by studying the journey of historic winners. The app would enable users to study the path adopted by historic winners in their respective fields, which would provide details on their life choices as well as academic performance prior to winning the nobel prize. In this case, the app will provide information like the top universities in the selected field, average number of publications, average academic performance, and others, based on the parameters selected or filters applied by the user. future work should aim to develop a decision making guide for academic professional by merging the details from the two datasets. This tool will allow users to evaluate their current performance, estimate the required efforts, and predict the likelihood of winning based on the historic data. Additionally, we would want to make performance improvements to the application. In order to improve the overall performance of the application, we would like to utilize caching of the plots to decrease the loading time. Furthermore, we could utilize the shinyloadtest package to analyze the performance of the app and continue to streamline its performance. Aesthetically, the interface could be improved as well to help increase the usability of the application. For example, making sure that plots are being properly formatted when filtering is being applied and so forth. It is important to always be evaluating the performance and usability of the application. "],
